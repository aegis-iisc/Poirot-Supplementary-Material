## Results

The Coq formalization of our core language and the soundness theorem are shown folder "proof".

## Benchmarks

- There are details of `14` benchmarks which are shown in folders with the same name of the benchmark under the "benchmarks" folder.
Each benchmark has a file `prog.ml` which presents the source code of input test generator and a file `ty.ml` present the coverage types, which include the coverage type we want to check against (having the same name of the input test generator) and the coverage types of the library functions (notated with `[@library]`). For example, there are three types in `RedBlackTree\ty.ml`: two types that have name `int_gen` and `bool_gen` which are the types of the library functions, one type has name `rbtree_gen` which is the type we want to check with the `rbtree_gen` program in `RedBlackTree\prog.ml`.

- The directory `synthesizer_input` contains the input specification files for the `5` benchmarks for which we generated synthesized generators (shown in Figure 9). For E.g. the file `synthesizer_input\sizedBST.spec` is passed to the synthesizer as input.

- The outputs generated by the synthesizer (containing multiple generators) are present in the formatted directories `_synth_<benchmark_name>\prog.ml`. E.g. the file `\benchmarks\_synth_sizedbst\prog.ml` contains the output of running the synthesizer on the file `synthesizer_input\sizedBST.spec`

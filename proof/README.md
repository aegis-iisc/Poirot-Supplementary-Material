## Differences Between Paper and Artifact ##

- Our formalization only has two base types: nat and bool,
- Our formalization only have four operators: `+`, `==`, `<`,
  `nat_gen`. Other operators shown in the paper can be implemented in
  terms of these four, for example, the minus operator can be defined as the function:

```
let minus (x: nat) (y: nat) =
    let (diff: nat) = nat_gen () in
    if x + diff == y then diff else err
```

In addition, to simplify the syntax, all operators take two arguments as input, the random nat generator takes two arbitrary numbers as input.
- In the formalization, to simplify the syntax, we only implement pattern matching over booleans. The pattern matching over natural number

```
match n with
| 0 -> f 0
| S n' -> g n'
```

can be implemented as the following

```
if n == 0 then f 0
else g (n - 1)
```

- In the formalization, we assume all programs are converted to  alpha-equivalent versions in which no variables with the same name.
- In the formalization, the substitution of refinement types are formalized into a state. It can help as to get rid of termination check of the fixpoint function in Coq when we define the logic relation.
- In the formalization, our coverage typing rules additionally require the all branches of pattern matching expression are type safe in the basic type system (they may not consistent with the coverage type we want to check). This guarantees program with coverage types can also be assigned a basic type.

## Axioms ##

Our formalization assumes the functional and propositional extensionality axioms (`FunctionalExtensionality` and `PropExtensionality`) in order to reason about equality of refinement types (we encode qualifiers as Coq propositions `Prop`). We also rely on the following assumptions, all of which are axioms in the file `Ax.v`.
- The renaming assumptions (e.g., there exists a variable name that is not free in a term), there is no duplicate bindings in a state.
- Well-typed programs are terminating. We assume there exists a well-founded relation over all constants, used for the check of decrease in the typing rule of the fix-point function; if a term can reduce to a value, then they have the same basic type (it can be implied by the preservation property if the programs always halt).
- Some syntax equivalence fact of our core language, for example `let x = e_x in x` is equal to `e_x`.
